1. One of the most popular tools is Jenkins, an open source CI tool, which is able to monitor your source code repository for new changes and respond in configurable ways. Jenkins is a continuous integration server and more. It consists of an automation engine and a plugin ecosystem that supports continuous integration, automated testing, and continuous delivery. You customize the delivery pipeline depending on your need.
2. The following list of Jenkins alternatives isnâ€™t in any particular order: GitLab, Atlassian Bamboo, CircleCI, TeamCity, Travis CI, BuildMaster, Bitrise, Spinnaker, UrbanCode, Buddy, Drone.io, AWS CodePipeline, CruiseControl, Integrity, Shippable, CodeShip, Buildkite, GoCD, Semaphore CI, Microtica, AppVeyor.
3. The implementation of CI/CD can be significantly faster and more customizable for users thanks to the steps and integrations that already exist in cloud-based solutions. Cloud-based services offer a high level of support and onboarding assistance, so you do not have to worry about having to boost your headcount. Building proper infrastructure for a self-hosted solution, such as a modern data center, can take months. Hardware also has to be replaced every few years to meet performance and security requirements. In most cases, self-hosted CI/CD tools come with new hiring needs. Network administration, reporting, and migrating data from the previous platform are all time-consuming tasks, and all make the installation of a self-hosted system a much longer process. In case of an on-premise system, recovering from downtime, backtracking codes, fixing bugs, and other blocks in the CI/CD pipeline mechanics usually require more time, resources, and personnel.
